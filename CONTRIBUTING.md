cd frontend
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage
```

### Manual Testing

1. **Deploy the contract** to Sepolia testnet
2. **Test the frontend** with different scenarios
3. **Test all interaction modes**: Number input, random generation, reset functionality
4. **Test FHEVM operations**: Threshold checking, max value comparison
5. **Verify privacy** by checking Sepolia Etherscan
6. **Test with multiple accounts** to ensure privacy
7. **Test button groups** and responsive design
